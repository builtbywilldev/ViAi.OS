🧠 ViAi.OS

A React-based simulation of an AI-integrated OS — clean, agent-ready, built for the future.

⸻

ViAi.OS is a terminal-grade interface illusion:
A frontend-first operating system UI — layered with real agent logic, autonomous workflows, and scoped memory ops.
	•	⚙️ Custom React shell styled like a terminal bootloader
	•	🎛️ Interactive click, hover, and modal components
	•	🧠 Core Morpheus logic powered by ui_console.py
	•	📐 Scoped folder structure (BEM–aligned, CLI-generated)
	•	🚫 Not a theme. Not a mockup. A real OS interface prototype.
