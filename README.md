🧠 What is Violet Collar?

Violet Collar is a mythic-grade, frontend-first OS simulation:
A React-powered terminal illusion layered with AI logic, agent workflows, and real memory hooks.

This isn’t a theme. It’s not a dashboard.
It’s a system shell — built for signal integrity and mythic UI precision.
🔧 Features

    Custom OS UI (desktop + mobile illusion)

    Click, hover, modal, and terminal-style components

    Core Morpheus console logic integrated via ui_console.py

    Fully structured folder hierarchy — BEM–aligned, CLI-generated

    Proprietary logic modules housed in ai__integration/
