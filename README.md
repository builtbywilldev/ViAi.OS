# 🧠 Red_Collar–OS

> A frontend simulation of a terminal-driven OS — built with React, styled like a myth.  

---

**Red_Collar–OS** is a mythic-grade system simulation:  
A frontend-first operating system UI — layered with real AI logic, terminal workflows, and agent-driven memory.

- ⚙️ Custom React OS illusion (desktop + mobile shell)
- 🎛️ Click, hover, and modal FX components
- 🧠 Core Morpheus console logic wired through `ui_console.py`
- 📐 Scoped folder structure (BEM–aligned, CLI-generated)
- 🚫 Not a template. Not a theme. A fully structured OS prototype.
