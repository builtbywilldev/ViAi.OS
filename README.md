## 🧠 What is Violent Collar?

**Violent Collar** is a custom-built, frontend-first operating system simulation —  
designed to mimic terminal workflows, inject memory-driven logic, and react like a synthetic system.

This isn't a theme.  
This isn't a template.  
This is a **containment shell** for something more intelligent.

## 🧩 Core Features

- 🖥️ **React-based terminal UI**  
- 🧬 **Agent-ready architecture** with memory ops  
- 🧠 **`ui_console.py`** for backend command simulation  
- 📐 **BEM-aligned structure**, built from CLI tooling  
- ⚠️ **Proprietary logic folder**: `ai__integration/`
